# Code Before DSA: The Ultimate Logic WarmUp Archive before you dive into DSA!

> 🚀 **Strengthen your logic, problem-solving, and programming fundamentals before diving into DATA STRUCTURE & ALGORITHMS!**

Welcome to **Code Before DSA** - a comprehensive YouTube series where I, **[Shubhashish Chakraborty](https://imshubh.site)**, solve 100–150 beginner/intermediate-level coding and logic-building problems. Each problem comes with a clear explanation, multiple language solutions *(intially on C++ only!)*, and an accompanying YouTube video to help you build a solid foundation.
